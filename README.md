# Udacity - Sandwich Club project

## Project Overview
In this project, we had to complete the **Sandwich Club** app to show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Learning description
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help you to better understand how it is processed.

## Learning outcome
Through this project, you will:
- Learn how to submit projects for review
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly

## Project description
Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements
display in a sensible way. Implement the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it
produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that you designed.

## Core functionality
* JSON data is parsed correctly to a Sandwich object in JsonUtils
* JSON is parsed without using 3rd party libraries
* DetailActivity shows all Sandwich details correctly
* Detail layout includes a ScrollView so all the details are visible in small screen devices
* Sandwich details are shown in a sensible layout. For example, ingredients appear next to the ingredients label
